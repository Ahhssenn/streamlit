# Streamlit Applications Collection

## 🌐 Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Streamlit applications demonstrating various data visualization and machine learning capabilities. Streamlit is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications with Python, making it ideal for data science projects and rapid prototyping.

## 📁 Applications

This repository includes multiple Streamlit applications:
- **01_test.py** - Test application for basic Streamlit functionality
- **02_app.py** - Interactive data application
- **03_plotly.py** - Data visualization with Plotly integration
- **04_plotly_animated.py** - Animated visualizations using Plotly
- **05_eda.app.py** - Exploratory Data Analysis application
- **iris.py** - Iris dataset visualization and analysis
- **ml_app.py** - Machine learning model demonstration

## ✨ Features

- Interactive web interfaces built with Streamlit
- Real-time data visualization
- Integration with popular data science libraries (Plotly, Pandas, etc.)
- Machine learning model demonstrations
